My name is Harmony Nguyen, and I'm a project coordinator in the [Cognition, Affect, and Temperament Lab](https://www.catlabpsu.com/) at Penn State University. In my role, I lead a longitudinal study examining parent-child interactions and anxiety transmission over time.

After earning my BA in Psychology from Cal Poly Pomona, I moved to Pennsylvania to build on my research and data skills. I'm currently learning R for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. In my future career, I plan to learn additional programming languages, so I can leverage data and support non-profits that promote family and child well-being.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, sightseeing, and going to Disneyland. I also love music and am an avid record collector! Below are some of my favorite songs of all time:
