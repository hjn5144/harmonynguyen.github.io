My name is Harmony Nguyen, and I'm currently a project coordinator in the [Cognition, Affect, and Temperament Lab](https://www.catlabpsu.com/) at Penn State University. I currently lead a longitudinal study examining parent-child interactions and anxiety transmission over time.

After earning my BA in Psychology from Cal Poly Pomona, I moved to Pennsylvania to pursue my research interests in parent-child interactions. I'm most interested in family stress and the contextual/environmental factors that influence the development of psychopathology. In my future career, I hope to leverage data to support non-profits aimed at supporting families and children's health.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, going to the beach, and attending concerts. I am also an avid record collector!
