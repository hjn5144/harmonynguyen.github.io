My name is Harmony Nguyen, and I'm a project analyst at [Quick Release_](https://www.quickrelease.co.uk/). In my role, I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to ensure data accuracy, identify and resolve data discrepancies, and analyze large-scale datasets, delivering findings key stakeholders.

After earning my BA in Psychology from Cal Poly Pomona, I became a research coordinator in the [Cognition, Affect, and Temperament Lab](https://www.catlabpsu.com/) at Penn State University. In my role, I led a longitudinal study examining parent-child interactions and anxiety transmission over time. Through this experience, I enhanced my research and project management skills and became further motivated to pursue a career in research.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, sightseeing, and going to Disneyland. I also love music and am an avid record collector! Below are some of my favorite songs of all time:
