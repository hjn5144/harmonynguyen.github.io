## Welcome!

Hello and welcome to my personal website! I created this to tell you more about myself, my interests, and my experiences.

I'm especially interested in understanding how people think and feel and am passionate about using those insights to help shape engaging content, whether that\'s through audience research, creative testing, or behavioral data.
